Creates an object that will be the student schedule, depending on the classes they pick
Takes in the sections of the classes they pick and assigns it to the schedule object.

Things to check for, or else throws exception??:
should only take one of each class.
This will also cover the case when a duplicate class is picked. 

Needs a constructor for all cases, up to if 5 classes are picked.

If 4-5 classes, then declare "full-time student".  Else, part-time student
